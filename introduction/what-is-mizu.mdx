MIZU data node, users can participate in our innovative ecosystem. Combined with our standardized query interface, MIZU offers easily accessible and low-risk data resources to the AI community, empowering developers to innovate and build a wide range of AI solutions.

Our platform includes a **DePIN** where any data holder can effortlessly join our ecosystem by simply running a MIZU data node. By leveraging our innovative data DePIN, we can seamlessly merge and host vast amounts of data at an exceptionally low cost. This groundbreaking approach empowers any data provider to effortlessly contribute to the MIZU data network.

The **edge network** is another cornerstone of MIZU's platform. This network enables anyone with a laptop or mobile device to participate in data pre-processing tasks. Any data imported into the network undergoes pre-processing with proper data tagging and data quality refinement using a 0.5B or 1B LLM model, optimized for mobile environments. The processed data is then stored in the network with a standardized schema and served through a unified query interface.

By leveraging this unified query interface, MIZU simplifies the development of AI applications. This streamlined approach empowers AI developers to effortlessly build customized datasets tailored to their specific needs. MIZU offers easily accessible and low-risk data resources to the AI community, enabling developers to innovate and build a wide range of AI solutions.
