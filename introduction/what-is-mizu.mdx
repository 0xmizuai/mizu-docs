### Open Source AI

Open-source AI has garnered significant attention in recent times, with the promise of democratizing access to powerful AI models and enabling collaborative development. However, the current state of open-source large language models (LLMs) falls short of being truly "open-source" in the fullest sense.

While the models and parameters of these LLMs are openly available, the training data recipes, training code, and training process often remain opaque. This lack of transparency limits the potential for customization and improvement by the wider developer community. Developers are restricted to fine-tuning the models, without the ability to modify the pre-training process itself. This limitation can be problematic, as it prevents developers from excluding the influence of potentially harmful or biased data that may have been inadvertently included during the pre-training phase.

__To draw an analogy, the current state of open-source LLMs is akin to the Windows operating system, where the source code is not fully accessible, and customization options are limited. In contrast, truly open-source AI models should be more like Linux, where every aspect of the system is transparent, modifiable, and community-driven.__

### The MIZU Open Data Network

MIZU is pioneering the development of the world's first open synthetic AI data layer by creating a decentralized synthetic data generation network.
