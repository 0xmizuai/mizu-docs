## Data-centric Applications

In the era of artificial intelligence, we are witnessing a paradigm shift in how applications are built. Before the AI revolution, applications were primarily built on top of code. Developers would write intricate software programs to create functionality and deliver value to end users. However, in the AI era, the foundation of applications is shifting from code to data.

### The Rise of Data-Driven Development

Just like the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process applied to GitHub repos, owners of data repos should be able to build and deploy AI-based applications easily. The data repo becomes the central hub for application development, with the data itself driving the functionality and performance of the application.

### Streamlining the Application Building Process

MIZU aims to streamline the process of building data-centric applications by providing a comprehensive framework for users to build and deploy AI applications. This framework will include:

1. **Data Management**: MIZU will provide tools for data generation, validation and versioning, ensuring that the data remains organized, accessible, and up-to-date.

2. **Model Training**: The framework will offer integrated tools for training AI models directly from the data repo, leveraging the high-quality data to create powerful and accurate models.

3. **Application Deployment**: MIZU will provide seamless deployment options, allowing users to easily deploy their AI applications built on top of the data repo.

### The Future of Application Development

MIZU's long-term vision is to become the end-to-end framework for building and deploying AI applications. By providing a comprehensive platform that combines data management, model training, and application deployment, MIZU aims to empower developers and organizations to create powerful, data-driven applications with ease.

As the AI revolution continues to unfold, data-centric applications will become increasingly prevalent, and MIZU will be at the forefront of this transformation, providing the tools and infrastructure needed to build the applications of the future.
