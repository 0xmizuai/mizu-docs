1. Job workers register at job manager
2. Job publishers publish jobs to job manager
3. Job managers dispatch task to job workers
4. Job workers process the task and submit the job results
5. Job managers aggregate the results and send back the claims
6. Job workers settle the claims per their needs

### Reward Settlement
The settlement process is straightforward. When a user completes a job and publishes the results, an aggregator checks for consistency between the results from different workers. If the workers reach a consensus on the final results, the aggregator signs a message and sends it to the user. This signed message serves as a coupon for points claims. The user can later submit a batch of these claims on-chain to claim their rewards.
