## Overview

The MIZU Data Network is designed to enable developers to deploy and run LLM-driven data workflows in a transparent, verifiable, and secure manner. The network is composed of three main components: the core network, the trusted data engine, and the AVS.

## Components

### 1. The Core Network

The core of the MIZU Data Network is a decentralized network where all nodes run a DataVM (Data Virtual Machine). The DataVM is similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) but is designed specifically for deploying and running data workflows instead of smart contracts.

MIZU will develop and release the very first workflow, which is a simple inference operation to generate data and validate it against the targeted repo. Users will be able to interact with the workflow by providing the prompt and specifying the target repo as input.

Developers can deploy and run customized data workflows as well, which will be compiled to atomic data operations or data tasks. These tasks are then picked up and executed by MIZU data nodes within the network. The Network maintains the execution and state of each data workflow, ensuring that the processing is carried out in a decentralized and transparent manner.

### 2. Trusted Data Engine

The Data Engine is a critical component of the MIZU Data Network to do the real data generation and validation work. We will support two types of data engines: the rule-based and the LLM-based.

#### 2.1 Rule-based Simulator

The rule-based simulator enables developers to generate synthetic data following some rules. This feature is particularly useful for creating simulated environments and datasets. For example, game engines like unity and unreal engine can be used to generate simulated street view images or 3D models. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) V12 heavily relies on simulators to generate street view pictures for training their autonomous driving models.

#### 2.2 LLM-based Engine

Developers can also call Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate, process, or annotate data directly. One example model/agent that can be used for this purpose is [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT). There are multiple projects are working on decentralized inference network(e.g. ritual) which MIZU could integrate with.

#### 2.3 Verifiable Inference Result

For now we are running our own centralized inference network and simualtor services. All generated results(from inference or simulatora) will be signed by a gateway to ensure that the results are trustable and verifiable. In the future, the network plans to integrate a distributed inference or simulator network to further enhance decentralization and scalability.

### 3. The AVS Layer

The security of the MIZU Data Network is guaranteed by the AVS (Actively Validated Services) Layers. The network follows a standard optimistic strategy for fraud proofs, separating the network nodes into two roles: executors and validators.

Executors are responsible for running data workflows, while validators verify the workflow executions. All MIZU nodes must stake tokens to join the network and can earn yield based on their staking. Users pay gas fees to executors to run their workflows.

The network assumes that all executors are honest, but they are required to generate proofs (merkle proofs or zero-knowledge proofs) for every workflow step and store these proofs on-chain. Anyone can request to challenge any executed step, triggering all validators to re-run the step and vote to slash the staking of malicious executors.

## Data Storage

The Data Storage Layer is responsible for hosting all intermediary results and outputs of data workflows, such as proofs and final datasets. This layer can be implemented using a Decentralized Autonomous (DA) layer, such as ZeroGravity or EigenLayer.

To optimize gas costs, the current design stores proof headers on-chain while storing the proof bodies in the DA layer. The final generated datasets are also hosted in the DA layer, making it easy for users to download, view, or replicate the data.

Each dataset is assigned a globally unique identifier, which can be referenced across multiple storage layers. This enables seamless integration and interoperability between different components of the MIZU Data Network and external systems.

## Conclusion

The MIZU Data Network provides a decentralized, secure, and verifiable platform for deploying and running data workflows. By combining the DePIN Network, Verifiable Inference Network, AVS Layers, and Data Storage Layer, the network enables developers to process and analyze data in a transparent and trustless manner, while ensuring the integrity and security of the data workflows through a robust verification and slashing mechanism. The addition of the Data Storage Layer further enhances the network's capabilities by providing efficient storage and retrieval of proofs and datasets, making them easily accessible to users and other systems.
