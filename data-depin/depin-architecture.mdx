## From Scale to Hyperscale

While traditional cloud services offer scalability, MIZUâ€™s Data Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) delivers true hyperscale capabilities. By leveraging our innovative data DePIN, we enable seamless and ultra-low-cost data processing at scale. This groundbreaking approach empowers anyone with a device to contribute to the MIZU data network by running a MIZU processing node. Participants can handle tasks like querying, crawling, cleaning, and classification, becoming an integral part of this expansive ecosystem that redefines data accessibility and affordability.

### **Super Node Network**

MIZU's super nodes consolidate, index, and manage data from various sources. They split and dispatch tasks across the edge network, serving as the coordination layer that powers scalable and efficient data processing.

### Data Processing Network

Data processing network augment data hosting network by assisting in the processing of imported data. Any edge device, including mobile devices and laptops, can join our edge network as data processing node. The details of the data processing network could be found at [the edge network section](http://localhost:3000/edge-network/architecture).

### Data Validator Network

Data validator nodes validate the integrity of data processed by data processing nodes. One has to buy the license and stake/re-stake to run a verifier node. The validation rules could found at the [data validation section](http://localhost:3000/data-depin/data-validation).
